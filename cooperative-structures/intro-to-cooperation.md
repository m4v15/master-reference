# Cooperation at Lotus: an Introduction

### Consensus

Consensus decision making is a style of decision making which requires consent (agreement) by all members of a group for decisions to be approved. 

Consensus is a democratic decision-making process that facilitates collective action. Consensus-based decision making is a structure that engages the whole community in the process of making decisions, and in particular, prevents a majority from dominating or alienating a minority. When consensus must be reached, the community must find a way to address disagreements in a productive manner and identify solutions that all can consent to.

### How does this work in practice?

The decision-making process typically begins with discussions on GitHub. After a period of discussion, a member (or group of members) drafts an issue containing a proposal explaining what they suggest the community do, providing appropriate context and listing action steps.

Members are expected to raise questions/concerns on the issue, so that the writer has time to adjust the proposal to better reflect the will of the whole community. 

The community then votes on the proposal at the monthly business meetings. We encourage you to [read more about the consensus process we've developed](https://github.com/lotus-coding-school/master-reference/blob/master/cooperative-structures/consensus-decisions.md), to contribute to issues, and to attend monthly business meetings to see the process in action. 

Decision-making can feel messy, especially when the goal is to make decisions that reflect the will of the whole community. As you become a part of this community, we encourage you to reflect on the process we've developed and to suggest ways we can improve it!

### Membership

A membership program should be discussed and implemented in Lotus to favour consensus-based decision making and grow the community over time.

Members can make proposals, vote on proposals, and join committees (such as finance) with delegated decision-making power.

An example of membership structure as implemented by Founders & Coders in London:
