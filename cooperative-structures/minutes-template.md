# Template for Meeting Minutes

Below is suggested template for taking meeting minutes at Lotus business and committee meetings. 

Minutes are a tangible record of the meeting for its participants and a source of information for members who were unable to attend. The `note-taker` does not need to record every word spoken, rather, minutes should synthesize the conversation and record:
- Major questions or concerns
- Decisions made
- Assignments made
- Action steps

If the `note-taker` finds it useful to take word-for-word notes, it is suggested that the `note-taker` review and summarize before submitting the minutes, to ensure that participants (and those unable to attend) can quickly and effectively review minutes
