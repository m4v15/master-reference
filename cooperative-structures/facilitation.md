# Guide: Facilitating Meetings at Lotus

Based on [A Short Guide to Facilitating Meetings](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortfacilitation), by Seeds for Change

_Good facilitators help groups conduct efficient and inclusive meetings. Depending on the size of meeting, one or more facilitators may be appropriate._

### Before the meeting, the facilitator should:
- Prepare a realistic meeting agenda, considering the timing and order of items
- Post and/or share the meeting agenda with all meeting participants
- Prepare the physical space (by forming a circle of chairs) or virtual space (by sending a Hangout link)

### At the meeting, the facilitator should:
- Introduce the purpose of the meeting and review the agenda
- Explain how decisions will be made in the meeting 
- Assign support roles, such as timekeeper, notetaker, and vibes-watch
- Keep the group to the agenda and decision-making process, including agreed-upon time limits 
- _Take active steps to ensure an inclusive discussion, by:_
   - Helping everyone to participate who wants to, by keeping track of who wants to speak, limiting those who speak frequently, and drawing out quiet people 
   - When appropriate, employing techniques such as go-rounds (where each person in the circle gets to speak for a set amount of time) to ensure all voices are heard
   - Clarifying and summarising points to ensure that everyone understands the discussion - as the conversation progresses, outline the emerging common ground as well as the unresolved differences: for example, "it seems like we've almost reached agreement on that element of the proposal, but we need to explore this part further to address everyone's concerns" 
   - Testing for agreement (using techniques such as fist to five and straw polls) to gauge group readiness for consensus
- _Help the group deal with conflict by:_ 
   - Actively listen for underlying issues, concerns or emotions
   - Identifying common ground and suggesting solutions to any areas of disagreement
   - Challenging aggressive or discriminatory behaviour and put-downs
- Work with the notetaker to ensure that action points and decisions are recorded 

### After the meeting, the facilitator should:
- Review meeting minutes and ensure they are merged in a timely fashion
- Prompt writers of approved proposals to create a file containing the final version and close related `discussion` and `proposal` issues
- In the event that a proposal was blocked, meet privately with the individuals involved to determine the root cause of the disagreement and to set appropriate action steps
