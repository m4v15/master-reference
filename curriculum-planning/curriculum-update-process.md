## Why
The curriculum planning process needs to be iterated based on lessons learned from the last curriculum planning session.

The newly introduced format of week working groups (WWG) led by week facilitators (WF) had mixed success. Feedback can be seen in the minutes of the [review meeting](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/735).

A more general issue raised was around a lack of clarity over who had ultimate responsibility over maintaining the coherence, direction and tone of the master-reference (MR), between the WF, course facilitators (CF) and master-reference maintainers (MRM), since all had been involved in decision making and merging of pull requests to some degree.

It is hoped a clearly defined process with clearer roles and responsibilities will benefit the curriculum planning process and better engage students.

## What
The curriculum working group propose the following:
1. Creation of a statement of overall curriculum outcomes/mission statement/philosophy (see #48)
2. Review week learning outcomes in light of (1) (see #691 and #692)
3. Creation of a style guide for the creation of curriculum resources to reflect (1)
4. Clarification of the roles of Students, CF, WF, MRM and the community with respect to curriculum planning and maintenance
5. Seek _active_ master-reference maintainers
6. Change the WF role to be reactive. Most weeks will not have one; only when there are changes that require closer oversight or coordination should a WF be sought
7. Update contributing guides in MR and other curriculum repos

## How
Elaborating on (4), the proposed breakdown of responsibilities is:

### Community
#### Immediate term
* Approve the overall curriculum outcomes/mission statement/philosophy (1)
* Declare interest in master-reference maintainer and week facilitator roles (5)
* Creation of a style guide reflecting (1) (3)

### Master-reference Maintainers
#### Immediate term
* Bring a proposal on the overall curriculum outcomes/mission statement/philosophy to the community (1)
* Review and update weekly learning outcomes as a result (2)

#### Recurring
* Once per cohort:
  * review curriculum feedback and course learning outcomes and generate reccommendations for changes, split into major/minor changes
  * Major changes should ideally be overseen by an alumnus (this is essentially the extent of the WFs new role)

* Regularly
  * Review & merge pull requests to _MR and all curriculum resources_ ensuring the quality and coherence of the resources

### Course Facilitators
#### Recurring
* Once per cohort:
  * Collate cohorts feedback on the curriculum and make available to the MRM for their review session

### Week Facilitators
Don't exist formally but alumni can be called on to serve in this role temporarily by MRM if there are changes to be made which require some level of oversight and coordination.

MRM can serve as week facilitators as a last resort.

### Students
#### Recurring
* Once per cohort
  * Provide course feedback to the CF
  * Minor changes reccommended by the MRM can be undertaken immediately by students

## Resource maintainer
The notion of a _"resource maintainer"_, where each curriculum resource would be maintained by one alumnus, is being retired. MRM will effectively be maintainers of every curriculum resource by default.

## Week by week schedule
### Rough idea, adaptable to needs of each campus/CF
#### Week 10
students| Course facilitators | MRM | Week Facilitator|Community
-|-|-|-|-
Review MR, feed back to CF big problems (e.g. workshop was useless, loose research afternoon, project was not good)|Find time for students to do this (3-6 hours). Raise an issue on the MR for the MRM, with problems and proposed solutions (if possible)|Review issues|nothing|Review the issue and give feedback if they want
#### Week 11
students| Course facilitators | MRM|WF | Community
-|-|-|-|-
If feasible, get into the week groups on the weeks they want to mentor. Review material more closely for smaller issues (e.g, typos, general copy of a workshop, fixing bugs). Add to a week issue about these problems. Begin trying to solve them|Find time for students to do this (3-6 hours)|Review issues|Review their week issue, just check if there are any big changes that should be flagged up to the MRM|Review the issue and give feedback if they want. 
#### Week 12
students| Course facilitators | MRM|WF | Community
-|-|-|-|-
Contunue week working groups. Check for what other campuses have said. Assign week facilitator to review PRs (or MRM if no WF)|Find time for students to do this (3-6 hours).|Should have feedback from all campuses, MRM's should meet and discuss them. Feedback to the community recommend actions that need to be taken (having considered each campus, any community input and also the learning outcomes) |Same as for week 11. Review pull requests, assign MRM for merge if all is good. |Review the big issue from MRM's, volunteer to make any changes they want to
#### Week 13
students| Course facilitators | MRM |WF| Community
-|-|-|-|-
Contunue as week 12, but look at big issue for stuff relevant to their week. If they want to they can make the change (potentially they may already have started it if it was their suggestion). If some alumni has volunteered, they should be aware as they will be teaching it in the next iteration | Find time for students to do this (3-6 hours) |Be aware of what changes are going ahead, and what aren't|Review pull requests, assign MRM for merge if all is good. |Any alumni can review PR's if they want to.
#### Week 14
students| Course facilitators | MRM |WF| Community
-|-|-|-|-
Contunue as week 13. Should beging mentor prep| Find time for students to do this (3-6 hours). Maybe how to be a mentor slides |Be aware of what changes are going ahead, and what aren't|Review pull requests, assign MRM for merge if all is good. |Any alumni can review PR's if they want to.

#### Week 15
students| Course facilitators | MRM |WF| Community
-|-|-|-|-
Contunue as week 14. Should beging mentor prep| Find time for students to do this (3-6 hours). Maybe how to be a mentor slides |Be aware of what changes are going ahead, and what aren't|Review pull requests, assign MRM for merge if all is good. |Any alumni can review PR's if they want to.
#### Week 16
students| Course facilitators | MRM |WF| Community
-|-|-|-|-
Contunue as week 15. Should beging mentor prep| Find time for students to do this (3-6 hours). Maybe how to be a mentor slides |Be aware of what changes are going ahead, and what aren't|Review pull requests, assign MRM for merge if all is good. |Any alumni can review PR's if they want to.
## Pros and Cons
### Pros
 - Retain community oversight of the whole course
 - MR maintainers are tasked with ensuring the overall coherence of the course (missing from FACN/G2/11 round) 
 - It is clear who has the final say on what goes into the curriculum (the maintainers, who should be speaking for the community (studentss & alumni))
 - It removes the pressure on WF's and makes it less burdensome, which could hopefully mean greater community participation.
 - Allows space for bigger changes to the curriculum to happen (missing/incohorent for FAC11/N2/G3)
 - No one has to chase the up for changes to happen. All proposals are recommendations. It's up to the whole community (mostly the students who will be teaching it) to make those changes. If they don't happen, it doesn't matter. 
 
 ### Cons
 - MRM have a lot of work, and, potentially power.
     - Don't think this will be an issue see below
     - maybe a lot of work, will see how it pans out
- Time constraints, co-ordinating campuses
    - This is always going to be an issue. Need to ensure students are looking at what other students in their WWG are saying (on gitter and through issues)
    - Changes don't _have_ to happen. Will have same (softish) deadline for changes (4 weeks before first delivery, apart from the first few weeks off the course).
- How this fits into campus divergence
    - Unsure, this becomes a question about the philosophy of the master reference (#591)
## Limits on power
MRM, ultimately, are servants of the community and as such their power should be both limited and accountable.

MRM are not empowered to drive any changes they see fit. All reccommendations they make must come about as a result of one or more of:
* Issues with the current curriculum resources identified by _students_ or _current CFs_.
* Identifying shortcomings in the way the course outcomes are embodied in the weekly learning outcomes and/or the curriculum resources. This is a matter of interpretation that is entrusted to MRM, but should be based on curriculum feedback.

> _(How are MRM accountable to the community??)_

This will be documented in a role description for the MRM.

## TLDR
Basically proposing something like the following (diagram made for Founders & Coders):
