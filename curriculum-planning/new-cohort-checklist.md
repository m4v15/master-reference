- [ ] Create a Slack chatroom for Lotus-X within the Lotus organisation, and delete the "incoming"/"lobby" room.
- [ ] Add new cohort to [Lotus coding School](https://github.com/lotus-coding-school) organisation, and:

Weekly curriculum task group along with current CF / maintainers of the `master-reference`:
- [ ] Ensure all curriculum related files are updated in `master-reference`
- [ ] Ensure the [coursebook](https://github.com/lotus-coding-school/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook) has been updated by the current mentors before start-date.

### On-going

Course Facilitator:
- [ ] Use the Google spreadsheet of past alumni who gave talks / external speakers, stored in school-curriculum, to continue arranging external speaker dates for the new curriculum. Update the list from last curriculum if necessary.
- [ ] Update the calendar every time a speaker is arranged.
